# Advent of Code 2016

These are my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2016](adventofcode.com).

Don't read them if you intend to play and don't want to be a filthy cheater.

I'm currently solving them in Python first, then porting it to nim.  Ideally I will learn enough nim in the process to start solving them in nim first. We'll see.

Comments appreciated!
